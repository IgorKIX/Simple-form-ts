# Simple-form-ts

This is a simple app which allows you to create a new user by the form or to choose the already created user from the list. After login/Sign in process you wil be able to creat the event, which once created, will be available on the list on the right side of the screen.

This is a "translation" of the [simple-form-react-node](https://github.com/IgorKIX/simple-form-react-node) to typescript.

### Status

For now, I'm moving features to ts. My goal is to move the React part - Node will probably stay in clean JS.
